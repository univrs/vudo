Based on biological principles, here is how real mycelial networks (fungi) exhibit the behaviors you listed. While the software on your screen uses these concepts as metaphors for digital orchestration, the biological reality is a complex system of fluid dynamics and chemical signaling.

1. Anastomosis: Hyphal Fusion
In real fungi, anastomosis is the physical fusion of two hyphae (fungal threads) to create a network.   

Mechanism: When two compatible hyphae grow near each other, they exchange chemical signals (pheromones). If they recognize each other as "self" or genetically compatible, the cell walls at the tips dissolve, and the plasma membranes fuse.   

Network Effect: This transforms the fungal colony from a simple branching tree into a complex, reticulated (web-like) network. This connectivity allows nuclei and cytoplasm to flow freely between previously separate strands, creating a single, massive organism rather than a collection of individual threads.   

2. Resource Translocation: Sink-Source Gradients
Fungi do not rely on a heart to pump nutrients; they use pressure gradients.

Mechanism: Translocation occurs via mass flow driven by turgor pressure. The network identifies a "Source" (where enzymes are digesting food) and a "Sink" (a growing tip or developing mushroom).   

The Flow: The fungus actively pumps osmolytes (salts/sugars) into the source area, drawing in water and increasing pressure. Simultaneously, the sink area consumes nutrients, lowering pressure. This pressure difference forces water and dissolved nutrients to rush rapidly through the network from source to sink, sometimes over many meters.

3. Adaptive Routing: Restructuring Around Damage
Mycelium is resilient because it is decentralized.   

Redundancy: Because of anastomosis (see above), there are usually multiple pathways to get from point A to point B. If a specific strand is severed or blocked (damage), the pressurized flow of cytoplasm simply takes the path of least resistance through adjacent connections, instantly rerouting around the injury.

Reinforcement: The network constantly optimizes. Pathways that successfully transport high volumes of nutrients are reinforced with thicker cell walls and wider diameters, while paths that lead to nowhere are often depolymerized (disassembled) and their resources recycled elsewhere.   

4. Fruiting Decisions: Coordinated Emergence
Creating a mushroom (fruiting body) is chemically expensive and requires the entire colony to "agree."

Competence Check: The network tracks its internal reserves. It will not fruit unless it detects it has accumulated enough carbon and nitrogen to complete the process.

The Trigger: Once competent, the network waits for environmental signals (often a drop in temperature, rain, or physical disturbance). When these signals are detected simultaneously across the network, it switches from "exploration mode" to "reproduction mode."

Coordination: The network stops sending nutrients to the outer edges and redirects all flow inward to specific nodes (primordia). This massive hydraulic injection inflates the mushroom rapidly, often overnight.
